Based on previous activities or explicit feedback, content-based filtering recommends other items similar to what the user likes.

If we want to recommend suggestions based on features such as genres, actors, overview, and so on, a content-based recommendation system is undoubtedly beneficial. The accuracy of content-based filtering improves when we use parameters like genres, cast, and crews, which provide more detailed information about the user's preferences. The most basic type of recommendation system is based on Demographic filtering, which just uses parameters like popularity, budget, and revenue; these fields do not provide any specific information that could help us determine the user's preferences/likes. Some limitations of content-based filtering include the fact that it can only create suggestions based on the user's existing interests and does not consider what other users think of an item, therefore low-quality item recommendations may occur at times.
